Group Project (Minnesota Historical Society)

Application Overview

This application will serve mainly MHS Admin and employees by providing them with a one-page application. It will allow admin/employees to upload images and add or overlay a set variety of MNHS branded patterns, where the patterns contain a text display created by the user.  The patterns will be user-specific, and employees will not have access to patterns outside of his/her department.  Images will be able to be submitted for approval to the Admin, and unapproved images will be able to be edited before being resubmitted.  Employees will have access to all images uploaded for that employees specific department.  


The admin will be able to assign, update, and delete employee access to the application.  The Admin will also have the ability to view all submissions, edit, approve or return the image to the user with a set of comments to help clarify the areas of improvement for the submission.  For convenience, submissions will be automatically categorized into separate buckets based on the submitterâ€™s credentials.  Once approved, images will be converted to a jpeg format with a maximum size of 3MB for convenience in uploading to SproutSocial.
